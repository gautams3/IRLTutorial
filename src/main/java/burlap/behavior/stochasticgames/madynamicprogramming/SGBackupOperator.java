 * A stochastic games backup operator to be used in multi-agent Q-learning or value function planning. This operator
 * is meant to be applied to a next state, takes the set of Q-values for that state for all agents and returns
 * the backup operator. The classic Bellman MDP approach would be o use a max operator, but in stochastic games,
 * different solution concepts require different operators.
