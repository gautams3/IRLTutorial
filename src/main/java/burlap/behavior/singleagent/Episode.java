/**
 * This class is used to keep track of all events that occur in an episode. This class should be created by either calling the constructor with the initial state of the episode,
 * or by calling the default constructor and then calling the {@link #initializeInState(State)} method to set the initial state of the episode, before recording
 * any transitions. It is then advised that transitions are recorded with the {@link #transition(Action, State, double)} method, which takes as input
 * the next state to which the agent transitioned, the action applied in the last recorded state, and the reward received fro the transition.
 * <p>
 * When querying about the state, action, and reward sequences, use the {@link #state(int)}, {@link #action(int)}, and {@link #reward(int)} methods.
 * These methods take as input the time step of the element you want. Note that t = 0 refers to the initial state step so calling getState(0) and getAction(0)
 * will return the initial state and the action taken in the initial state, respectively. However, rewards are always received in the next time step
 * from the state and action that produced them. Therefore, getReward(0) is undefined. Instead, the first reward received will be at time step 1: getReward(1).
