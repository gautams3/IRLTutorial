/**
 * Tabular Q-learning algorithm [1]. This implementation will work correctly with Options [2]. The implementation can either be used for learning or planning,
 * the latter of which is performed by running many learning episodes in succession in a {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.environment.SimulatedEnvironment}.
 * If you are going to use this algorithm for planning, call the {@link #initializeForPlanning(int)}
 * method before calling {@link #planFromState(State)}.
 * The number of episodes used for planning can be determined
 * by a threshold maximum number of episodes, or by a maximum change in the Q-function threshold.
 * <p>
 * By default, this agent will use an epsilon-greedy policy with epsilon=0.1. You can change the learning policy to
 * anything with the {@link #setLearningPolicy(burlap.behavior.policy.Policy)} policy.
 * <p>
 * If you
 * want to use a custom learning rate decay schedule rather than a constant learning rate, use the
 * {@link #setLearningRateFunction(burlap.behavior.learningrate.LearningRate)}.
