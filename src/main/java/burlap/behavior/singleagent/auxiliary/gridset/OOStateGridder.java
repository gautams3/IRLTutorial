/**
 * This class is used to generate a set of continuous states that are spaced over grid points that are factored as and OO-MDP
 * using {@link OOState}.  This class will generate a grid along dimensions for objects in the state belonging to specified
 * classes. To set the dimensions of objects of a specific object class to be part of the grid, use the
 * {@link #gridObjectClass(String, FlatStateGridder)} method.
 * <p>
 * In principle, the {@link FlatStateGridder} could be used to accomplish the same effect, but grids would have to
 * be specified for every object-dimension pair. That is, if there are two objects of the same class, a {@link FlatStateGridder}
 * would require you independently set the grid specification for object. This class streamlines that process by
 * having you specify the gridding along each object class of interest, and it will automatically replicate
 * the grid specification for each object in the state that belongs to that class.
 * <p>
 * Grid a state with the {@link #gridState(MutableOOState)} method. If the state contains objects that belong to
 * classes that do not have grid specifications assigned for them, then they will be held constant in the returned
 * states.
