/**
 * This class is used for general purpose linear VFA. It only needs to be provided a {@link SparseStateFeatures} object that will be used to store
 * retrieve state features. For every feature returned by the feature functions, this class will automatically create a weight associated with it.
 * The returned approximated value for any state is the linear combination of state features and weights.
 * <p>
 * This class can also be used for state-action value function approximation, which it will perform by creating
 * state-action features as a cross product of the state features and action set. You should only ever using this class
 * for state-values or state-action values, not both.
