/**
 * A State instance is used to define the state of an environment or an observation from the environment. Creating
 * a state requires implementing three methods to ensure compatibility with all BURLAP tools. First, the
 * {@link #variableKeys()} method should return a list of objects that represent the possible keys that are used
 * to reference state variables in your state. In general, a state variable is any value that when changed alters
 * the identification of the state. That is, two states with different state variables would not be equal and transition
 * dynamics and reward functions from them may be different as a result.
 * <br><br>
 * Next the {@link #get(Object)} method should accept any argument that is listed in the {@link #variableKeys()} list
 * and should return the value of that variable. You do *not* have to guarantee that changes the client makes to the
 * returned value will affect the state.
 * <br><br>
 * Finally, the {@link #copy()} method must be implemented so that a copy of this state can be created.
 * State copy operations are often performed when generating state transitions, or when a copy of the information
 * needs to be held by some other data structure. The copy may be a shallow copy
 * or deep copy and is domain/implementation specific. For clarity, the State implementation may indicate its copy mode with the
 * {@link DeepCopyState} or {@link ShallowCopyState} annotations. If it is a shallow copy, you should not *directly*
 * modify any fields of a copied state without copying the fields first, or it could contaminate the state from
 * which the copy was made. Alternatively, use the {@link MutableState#set(Object, Object)} method to modify
 * {@link ShallowCopyState} copied states,
 * which for {@link ShallowCopyState} instances should perform a safe copy-on-write operation.
