/**
 * An {@link ActionType} acts as a generator for {@link Action} objects. Its job is to define any preconditions for an
 * {@link Action}, so that {@link Action} objects with unsatisfied preconditions for an input state are not generated
 * in the state as well determine the set of valid parameterizations for a given input state. For example, in
 * a {@link burlap.domain.singleagent.blocksworld.BlocksWorld}, the number of stack actions is dependent on the number
 * of clear blocks, and blocks that are not clear cannot be stacked on other blocks because their precondition
 * is not satisfied.
 * <p>
 * You can also use an {@link ActionType} to generate different parameterizations of an {@link Action}, even when
 * the parameters are not state dependent, but it is usually not necessary to do so and you might instead consider
 * creating a separate {@link ActionType} for each parameterization.
