/**
 * An implementation of the classic Tiger domain. In this problem an agent is faced with two closed doors side by side:
 * a left door and a right door. Behind one is a prize (or something corresponding to high reward); behind the other
 * is a tiger that will eat the agent. The goal is the for the agent to open the door with the prize. However, the catch
 * is that the agent cannot know for certain which door the tiger is behind. To gain information, the agent can listen to
 * the doors, which will produce a noisy observation regarding whether they hear the tiger behind the left or right door. Listening incurs a small
 * reward cost, choosing the door with the prize gives a large positive reward, and choosing the door with the tiger incurs a large
 * reward cost. This domain may optionally be specified to include a "do nothing" action which has no cost and provides no reward.
 * It is useful when testing an algorithms willingness to take exploratory actions.
