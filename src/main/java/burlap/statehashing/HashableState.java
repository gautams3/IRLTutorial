/**
 * An interface for an object that computes hash codes and performs equality checks for states. Having a separate object
 * for these operations than the underlying state can be useful since it is often the case that different algorithms may want to pose abstractions
 * on the underlying state or handle equality in different ways than the raw {@link State} implementation.
 * Primarily, this is a marker interface to indicate that the object has implementations of
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)}, but it does also require implementing the
 * {@link #s()} method, which should return the underlying state on which the hash and equals operations of this object are
 * performed.
